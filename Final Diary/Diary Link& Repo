# Reflection of Dear Diary:  
#### From this project, I learnt that to have an accurate and efficient data base is not only important, but also difficult. Since the beginning of diary recording, I always forgot to write down my daily diary entry and as a result, data accuracy of the first few entries was affected and I ended up not using these. Later I found ways to make reminders in order to keep my data accurate. 
#### Then In this project, I also learnt that to have a early plan and know more thoroughly about what's the data is for will benefit my project. At the beginning, I didn't know we are going to make visualization for this data set and I also have no idea about why we need to query or how the interface will look like. So I did not think of the query when making dynamo db table, as a result, I had some difficulty query my data and had to remake a new table to make it suitable for my data. 
#### Originally I designed a more complex visualization for my daily entry, but I couldn't really make that happen, so I have to choose a libriary chart. I was able to put three of my data sets into the line and bar chartï¼Œ but the rest of data sets were not able to add, so I added an ideal visualization here to demonstrate what the complete visualization should look like. Ideally, When I hover to each bar, there will be three sets of data appear, as well as the rest of entries including healthy condition and diary.
