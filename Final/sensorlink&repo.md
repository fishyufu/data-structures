#### The sensor data is the more straightforward one among the three projects for me. When I came up with this idea, I wanted to measure the total days/times when the light intensity is over the maximum standard that human eyes can bear without any damage. However, after my research, I found that for different people, there is no one single maximum light intensity value to measure because all eyes are difference. Therefore, I decided to change my query and switch to measure the daily maximum light intensity value and the change of it over the month of November. 
#### I chose bar chart here because the comparison and trend of max light intensity change would be very obvious. Overall I think this data set and visualization has the best maintainability because I fully understand the query and the relationship between the data set and my visualization here. I will be able to update data values or change the query for example from daily maximum to daily average easily.
