# Reflection of Dear Diary:  
## From this project, I learnt that to have a data base is not only important, but also difficult. Since the beginning of diary recording, I always forgot to write down my daily diary entry and as a result, data acuracy of the first few entries was affected. Later I found ways to make reminders in order to keep my data accurate. 
## Then In this project, I also learnt that to have a early plan and know more throughly about what's the data is for will benefit my project. At the beginning, I didn't know we are going to make visualization for this data and I also have no idea about why we need to query or how the interface will look like. So I did not think of the query when making dynamo db table, as a result, I had some difficulty query my data and had to remake a new table. 
## Originally I designed a more complex visualization for my daily entry, but I couldn't really make that happen, so I have to choose a libriary chart. I was able to put three of my data set into the line and bar chartï¼Œ but the rest of data set was not able to added, so I added a ideal visualization in here too.
