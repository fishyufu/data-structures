## AAmeeting Repo
#### We've worked on this AA meeting for the entire semester now. At the beginning, I was super confused about why we need to select and clean data. The process of data cleaning for all ten zone was very painful. It was helpful to work with group, but at the same time, it was also a mess because there are some maintainabilty issues we encounter. Each of us have different names in our coding or title for each data variable so when we try to imput data from teamates, we have to change the name to make everything consistent. I'm sure it's not a big deal for someone with more expierence in coding, but for me I defenitely had headache. In the future, we should better talk about these consistency and coding transfer issues beforehead for better understanding and efficiency. 

#### In the final project, I finished the tutorial from leaflet, as well as data query part and I think I had a better understanding of how the database works to contian my data as well as the group by query. However, I still did not figure out why there is no map showing up from my coding, but I have a visualizaiton image here to demonstrate what will it look like. 

#### Overall, I think this is a big progress for me. I did not expect to learn much in data visualization field, but knowing more "hidden" information behind computer, database and data visualizaiton definitely help me to have a better understanding between human and computer.
